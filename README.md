My Depot App from Agile Web Development with Rails 4

When I first was learning RoR this was the book that 
contributed the most to my learning.  I wanted to go back 
and actually get this on Github for my own review and
reference.  

Yes a lot is copy and paste but I really did go through
~98% of this.
